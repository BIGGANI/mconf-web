# Check if the subject can(not) do anything to the target.
# Exists because "should be_able_to(:manage, target)" guarantees that
# a user CAN do anything, but "should_not be_able_to(:manage, target)"
# does not guarantee that a user cannot to anything, only that he
# cannot :manage the target (but he could be able to :read it, for instance).
# Only makes send when used with "should_not".
# Examples:
#   it { should_not be_able_to_do_anything_to(object) }
#   it { should_not be_able_to_do_anything_to(object).except(:read) }
