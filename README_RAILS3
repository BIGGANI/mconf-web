Notes on the migration to Rails 3.0.3

Current status:
- Migration completed. There are still some issues, but the app core is functional.

Notes:
- Plugin rails_upgrade was used to get some directions.
- Plugin rails_rcov not used anymore. Now using a simpler solution: http://www.betaful.com/?p=498
- attachment_fu installed as plugins from a fork compatible with rails 3.
  - Fork: git://github.com/mconf/attachment_fu.git
  - Working better than alternative: http://github.com/woahdae/attachment_fu.git -r rails3
  - See: https://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/pull/30 and https://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/issues#issue/10
  - Still had to adapt the monkey patch, see TODO below.
- Other plugins now used as gems:
  - fckeditor
  - exception_notification => exception_notification_rails3
  - simple_captcha (from git://github.com/galetahub/simple-captcha.git)
  - will_paginate (not mislav-will_paginate anymore)
  - action_mailer_optional_tls not used anymore in favor of action_mailer_tls
  - permalink_fu
- Now using Rspec 2. Installed as gem, not as plugin anymore.
- Using ffaker instead of faker (as gem).
- Corrected lots of deprecated behaviors:
  - RAILS_ROOT => Rails.root (except for plugins)
  - named_scope => scope
  - update_on_* arg => update arg :on => *
  - after_* and before_*
  - and many others
- PDF creation was disable, see TODO list.
- Plugin station was also migrated to Rails 3 / Ruby 1.9. Needed several changes, it should be better tested.

TODO:
- acts_as_tree plugin was modified (named_scope), decide what to do with the code.
- Tempfile monkey-patch in attachment_fu/init.rb was adapted and disabled for Ruby >= 1.9 only. Should check Tempfile.new calls using Ruby 1.9.
  - See https://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/issuesearch?state=open&q=make_tmpname#issue/25 and http://marsorange.com/archives/of-mogrify-ruby-tempfile-dynamic-class-definitions
- Ultrasphix does not support Rails 3. All related coded is commented. Maybe can be replaced by http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/rails3.html
- config/routes.rb should be revised. All routes were migrated, but need to be tested.
- Search for 'TODO rails 3:' for a list of things still to be migrated. Although some are with "TODO" only.
- List the changes made in station.
- pdf-writer is not compatible with Rails 3. Alternative: PDFKit at https://github.com/jdpace/PDFKit
  - Reimplement lib/event_to_pdf.rb
- Rspec:
  - See spec/controllers/translate_controller_spec.rb. Code was commented.
