Notes on the migration to Rails 3.0.3

Actual status:
- Partly migrated the app, with several restrictinos. Should now migrate the plugin 'station'.

Notes:
- Plugin rails_upgrade was used to get some directions
- Plugin rails_rcov not used anymore. Now using a simpler solution: http://www.betaful.com/?p=498
- attachment_fu installed as plugins from a branch in their repository
  - ./script/rails plugin install http://github.com/woahdae/attachment_fu.git -r rails3
  - See: https://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/issues#issue/10
- Other plugins now used as gems:
  - fckeditor
  - exception_notification => exception_notification_rails3
  - simple_captcha
- Using ffaker instead of faker (as gem)
- rspec issue 'no such file to load -- spec/rake/spectask' solved with: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/156080 (see the first response). There may be a better solution.

TODO:
- Ultrasphix does not support Rails 3. All related coded is commented. Maybe can be replaced by http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/rails3.html
- config/routes.rb should be revised. All routes were migrated, but need to be tested.
- Plugin station should be migrated to Rails 3 / Ruby 1.9
- ruby-debug should be replaced by ruby-debug19. Not used yet because its installation stalls
- Search for 'TODO rails 3:' for a list of things still to be migrated
