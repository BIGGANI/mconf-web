# This file contains configurations used in the deployment.
#
# deploy.rb loads this file and deploy/production.rb or deploy/staging.rb will
# load the configurations. "staging" and "production" are the two stages defined
# by default in deploy.rb. We use "staging" as a test server before deploying to
# "production"
# To add another stage simply copy staging.rb, rename it and add the new stage to
# deploy.rb (search for "set :stages")
#
# You can redefine here pretty much any variable available to Capistrano and it will
# override the default values set in deploy.rb.
# The variables we left here (commented or not) were already tested and you can use
# them in this file.
#
