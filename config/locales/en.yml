  faq:
    tag: "FAQ"
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    faq1:
      question: "What is Global Plaza?"
      answer: "Global Plaza is an open space for collaboration, a meeting point for professionals, where they can share documents and videos and organize and participate in videoconferences, in a modern web environment."
    faq2:
      question: "Why Global? Why Plaza?"
      answer: "<b>Global</b> is the name of the <a href=\"http://www.global-project.eu/\">European project</a> where this site has been developed, reusing results and developments from other projects, and providing a <i>cloud</i> orientation.<br><b>Plaza</b>, from latin <i>plattĕa</i> refers to an open urban public space, the traditional center of all economic and social interactions in a city. <b>Social</b> and <b>interactions</b> quite define the philosophy of this place."
    faq3:
      question: "What do I need to enter Global Plaza?"
      answer: "To participate in Global Plaza community you only need a web browser (mostly all of them work quite nicely). Some advanced features, such as videoconferencing, request you to have installed the <a href=\"http://get.adobe.com/es/flashplayer/\">Flash plugin</a> (as well as a webcam and microphone). It is quite probable that you already meet all the requirements."
    faq4:
      question: "How do I join and participate in the community? Is it free?"
      answer: "To start collaborating in Global Plaza you only need to <a href=\"/signup\">register</a>. That way you will be able to create spaces, add documents, and attend meetings. Checking Global Plaza <a href=\"/help\">help pages</a> is a nice stating point to find your way.<br><b>Free?</b> YES, everything in Global Plaza is free, and will continue to be so. We believe that YOU are the ones providing the value to our social network, and it would not be fair to charge you, would it?"
    faq5:
      question: "But... everything is accesible by anyone? ANYONE can interact with ANYTHING?"
      answer: "No, of course not. As said before, we are of the idea that there is more value in more people creating/accesing contents, but that does not mean that you cannot have your <b>private spaces</b>. Those will be accesible only by those members that you select, and their content will remain private and hidden for the rest."
    faq6:
      question: "Spaces? What spaces? What the heck are spaces?"
      answer: "An <b>space</b> is the basic unit of collaboration in Global Plaza. As you might guess, it is no more (and no less) than a place where people with a common interest can interact. That interaction can take place in a number of ways: using the document repository, organizing events, participating in videoconferences or chats...<br>Once you create an space, Global Plaza provides you with the facilities to do that, and much more. You only have to decide who to invite to your space, and if it will be public or private."
    faq7:
      question: "You mentioned videoconferences... can I organize one for tomorrow?"
      answer: "Global Plaza is a site that revolves around videoconferencing and, as such, our mind is in simplifying the effort to organize them. We suggest that you take a look at the help pages to create a <a href=\"help/newvirtualmeeting\">virtual meeting</a>, and start experimenting yourself."
    faq8:
      question: "Wait a moment! And can I organize FIVE simultaneous videoconferences for tomorrow?"
      answer: "As with any system, resources are not unlimited. We try to guarantee enough resources for all the events, but if an event cannot be held on an specific date/time, you will be notified at creation time."
    faq9:
      question: "Are meetings recorded?"
      answer: "Yes. At an event creation time, you can check if you want <b>recording</b> enabled. If that is the case, the sessions will be automatically recorded, and accessible afterwards in the event main page.<br>We are working to allow you download those same videos to watch them locally on your machines or distribute them."
    faq10:
      question: "I have an iPad, which has no Flash plugin... can I still watch the videos?"
      answer: "We are currently doing our best to convert all our videos to HTML5. That includes real-time streaming of events, using <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-04\">HTTP Live Streaming</a>. Soon you will be able to enjoy it in your mobile terminals."
    faq11:
      question: "I am Spanish/French/German/... Is Global Plaza translated to my language?"
      answer: "As of now, <i>only</i> English, Spanish, French and German are supported. To select among them just use the link <b>Language</b> at the bottom of any Global Plaza page.<br>We are constantly improving internationalization, and if you think you can lend us a hand, please <a href=\"feedback/new\">contact</a> us."
    faq12:
      question: "I have plenty of nice ideas for your site. Do you accept suggestions? How can I contribute to the development?"
      answer: "Although we think Global Plaza is already quite nice, we agree that everything can be improved. The best way to help us is by sending feedback using the <a href=\"feedback/new\">link</a> at the bottom of every page. We will appreciate any comment, and take care of it as soon as its possible."

Also, you might wnat to provide documents needed for the meeting or later share pictures taken at the meeting.<li>The <b><a href=%{url_vm}>Virtual meeting </a></b>type is suited for online meetings or physical meetings with a strong virtual component, meaning that both local and remote participants will have the opportunity to communicate interactively.<li>The <b> <a href=%{url_vc}>Virtual congress</a> </b>type is very similar to <i>the virtual meeting</i> but geared for larger events, both in size and complexity.
