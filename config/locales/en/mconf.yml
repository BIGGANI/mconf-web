      answer: "This FAQ, as this entire website, is based on Global Plaza. If you don’t find here the answer you’re looking for, maybe you can find it in the <a href=\"http://globalplaza.org/faq\">Global Plaza FAQ</a>."
      question: "About this FAQ"
    faq1:
      answer: "Mconf is an open source project that aims to provide a webconference system with the capability to interoperate transparently between desktop computers and mobile devices.<br><br>This website you're on is called Mconf-Web, the web application that manages the webconferences in Mconf. Mconf-Web is built on top of <a href=\"http://globalplaza.org\">Global Plaza</a> that is (as stated in it's own website): \"a space for collaboration, a meeting point for professionals, where they can share documents and videos and organize and participate in videoconferences, in a modern web environment\".<br><br>You can find more about Mconf and Mconf-Web in the following websites:<ul><li>Our project's page: <a href=\"http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/prav/gtmconf\">http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/prav/gtmconf</a></li><li>Our Google Code page, with issue tracking and documentation (wiki): <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf\">http://code.google.com/p/mconf</a></li><li>Our GitHub user, where all our code is hosted: <a href=\"https://github.com/mconf\">https://github.com/mconf</a></li></ul>"
      question: "What is Mconf?"
    faq2:
      answer: "To start collaborating in Mconf you only need to <a href=\"http://mconf.inf.ufrgs.br/signup\">register</a>. That way you will be able to create spaces, add documents and attend meetings. Checking Mconf help pages is a nice starting point to find your way.<br><br>Free? Yes, you can use this server for free, but be aware that this is a test server and we do not guarantee that it will be running 100% of the time (though it will probably be close to that)."
      question: "How do I join and participate in the community? Is it free?"
    faq3:
      answer: "A <b>space</b> is the basic unit of collaboration in Mconf. As you might guess, it is a place where people with a common interest can interact. That interaction can take place in a number of ways: using the document repository, organizing events, participating in webconferences, and others. And Mconf provides you with the facilities to do that, and much more. You only have to decide who to invite to your space, and if it will be public or private.<br><br><b>Public spaces</b> are viewable by anyone, even by visitors that do not have an account in Mconf. But, even though everyone can view it, only authorized people can alter it (create events and post messages, for example).<br><br><b>Private spaces</b> are only viewable by authorized people. You can create a private space and only give access to your friends or to people from your workplace, for example. Nobody else will be able to see the activity inside this space (but they will know that the space exists)."
      question: "Spaces? What spaces? What the heck are spaces?"
    faq4:
      answer: "Mconf is a site that revolves around webconferencing and, as such, our mind is in simplifying the effort to organize them. Underneath, Mconf uses a customized version of <a href=\"http://bigbluebutton.org\">BigBlueButton</a> as the webconference system, and Mconf-Web allows you to create and manage your own webconferences."
      question: "Did you mention… webconferences?"
    faq5:
      answer: "There are basically two types of webconferences in Mconf.<br><br>When a user registers in this website, he/she automatically receives a webconference room (<b>user’s room</b>). This room can be shared with anyone the user would like to hold a conference with, even with people that do not have a Mconf account. The room’s owner is always the conference moderator, while the other participants have limited attendee privileges.<br><br>The user rooms are by default public, so anyone with the link to it will be able to access it. But it can be made private and you can even define a password to it (note: this is still a work in progress).<br><br>The other type of webconference happens inside a space. Every space created in Mconf has a webconference room associated (<b>space’s room</b>). If the space is public, the room is public. Otherwise, the room is private and there will be a password associated to it.<br><br>As public spaces, public space’s rooms can be accessed by anybody, but only the space’s members will have moderator privileges. Likewise, private space’s rooms will only be accessible by members of the space."
      question: "Ok, but how can I create a webconference?"
    faq6:
      answer: "As of now, we give support to the following languages: <b>English</b> and <b>Portuguese (Brazil)</b>. However, we also have Mconf-Web partially available in the languages <b>Spanish</b>, <b>French</b> and <b>German</b>. To select among them just use the link “Language” at the top of any page. We are constantly improving internationalization, and if you think you can lend us a hand, please <a href=\"http://mconf.inf.ufrgs.br/feedback/new\">contact us</a> or <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf/wiki/MconfWebLocalization\">take a look at our wiki</a>, that contains some instructions on how to translate this website."
      question: "I am Spanish/French/German/Brazilian... Is Mconf translated to my language?"
    faq7:
      answer: "You’re great! We are very glad you’re interested in giving your contribution to Mconf. So, how can you contribute?<br><br>First, take a look at our <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf\">Google Code page</a>, where you can find the issue tracking system with all tasks currently in development and also all our documentation (wiki). After that, if you want to contact us, register yourself in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mconf-dev\">our mailing list</a> and send us a message.<br><br>There are plenty of things you can do. You can help by solving a bug, maybe? Or, if you’re not a developer, maybe you can install Mconf and provide some feedback? You can also help with translations if you speak many languages. We will appreciate any comments and suggestions, feel free to interact with us."

    draft: "Note: this page's a draft and is not yet active in mconf.org."
    paragraph_1: "<p>The following terms and conditions have to be accepted and complied by all Users of the service offered in the URL mconf.org, therefore IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE ITEMS REFLECTED HEREBY, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE NOR UPLOAD ANY VIDEO TO MCONF. If you register on mconf.org, you expressly agree to all terms and conditions herein expressed.</p><p>Mconf is a platform that allows the creation and participation in webconferences, as well as the sharing of related information. This website is developed in the research group PRAV, as a working group in the Brazillian NREN named RNP. For the purposes of these terms of use, this website is owned both by RNP and PRAV, and developed by PRAV, located in the following address: UFRGS, Instituto de Informática | Av. Bento Gonçalves, 9500 Bl. IV Campus do Vale | Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.</p><p>Preliminary Notes:<ul><li>Only Users that meet the requirements of Section II shall register.</li><li>Users that upload content (images, text, etc.) to Mconf shall have all the necessary rights to do so (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, image, etc.).</li><li>Registered Users must accept these terms of use entirely in order to use Mconf.</li></ul></p>"
    paragraph_10: "<h3>IX - GENERAL</h3><p>The User also undertakes to respect the applicable law.</p><p>Mconf reserves the right to modify, limit or terminate these terms at any time and any legal advice, guidelines, rules of use, privacy policy, etc., always respecting the law. The new conditions will apply to Users from fifteen (15) days after they were accessible in the domain mconf.org. Mconf recommends to check periodically the Terms of Use to meet the conditions that apply, without prejudice to decide unilaterally in any way (through an e-mail or similar) to notify the registered Users any substantial changes in these conditions.</p>"
    paragraph_11: "<h3>X - APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3><p>These conditions are written in English and are subject to Brazillian law. For any dispute arising from the use of the services offered or the content of the Site, the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Porto Alegre capital, except in cases where it is not possible by law, shall apply in any case the Braillian Legislation."
    paragraph_12: "<h3>XI - USE OF THE FEDERATION CAFE</h3><p>mconf.org allows the User to log in the system through a federated identity provider from the Brazillian federation <a href=\"http://www.rnp.br/servicos/cafe.html\">CAFe</a> (Comunidade Acadêmica Federada). In this case, the User authenticates in an identity provider registered in the federation, that redirects him to mconf.org after the authentication process. mconf.org will NOT have access to the User's password. The federation will only disclose to mconf.org the User's name, last name, email, afilliation, and his unique identifier in the federation (for more information see <a href=\"http://www.rnp.br/servicos/cafeespecificacao.html\">this site</a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.rnp.br/display/cafewebsite/brEduPerson\">this site</a>).</p><p>Given a User (name it \"fed-User\") that is using the federation to access mconf.org, he agrees that:<ul><li>Given the fed-User's email returned by the identity provider, if there is already a user registered with this email in mconf.org (name it \"mconf-User\"), the fed-User will be granted access to the mconf-User's account. The website will then behave just as if the mconf-User had made its login using the standard login procedure available in mconf.org (i.e. not using the federation);</li><li>If there is no user registered with the fed-User's email, a new account will be created in mconf.org, using the fed-User's name, last name and email, as returned by the identity provider. This new account will then be available to the User both through the federated login and through the standard login procedure. In other words, the next time the User access mconf.org using the federation, he will be granted access to this new account created in his first access. In case the User wants to access this account using the standard login procedure, he will need to first login using the federation and then define a password for the account.</li></ul></p><p>The terms of use for users authenticated using the federation are the same Terms of Use as defined in this page for all the users that access mconf.org. The privacy policy for the user data received by the federation is under the same terms as the data of all registered users, as defined in the <a href=\"/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>. When accessing mconf.org using the federated login the User agrees with these Terms of Use and the <a href=\"/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>"
    paragraph_2: "<h3>I - SERVICE</h3><p>Mconf.org (hereinafter the Site) is an online platform to create and participate in webconferences for distance education, virtual meetings, or any other similar purpose. In the Site are offered to registered Users (hereinafter User and in plural, Users) the ability to upload content for storage and later make them available on the Site for other Users.</p><p>Only registered Users have the ability to download certain material uploaded by another registered User, and to comment, participate in conferences, or any other functionality that could be added in the future.</p>"
    paragraph_3: "<h3>II - USERS</h3><p>All Users may be individuals with legal capacity. Consequently, children or older people without full legal capacity may not register.
