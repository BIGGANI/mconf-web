# Default configurations
# The values defined here will be used as default for all environments (development, test,
# production). You can also define specific configurations for each environment to override
# the defaults. To do that, copy the parameters you want to override and paste them inside
# the environment you want. These environments are commented in the end of this file.
default:

  # Admin account
  # You can change the password after the initial setup from within the application.
  admin:
    login: "mconf"                             # admin's login
    fullname: "Mconf Admin"                    # admin's full name
    email: "my-email@server.com"               # admin's email
    password: "admin"                          # admin's password

  # BigBlueButton default server configuration
  # This server will be your first and default server
  bbb_server:
    name: 'Default Server'                                 # server name
    url: 'http://my-development-server/bigbluebutton/api'  # server url in the format http://<server>/bigbluebutton/api
    salt: 'my-secret-salt'                                 # server salt
    version: '0.7'                                         # bbb version

  # Email account used to send all emails from within the application (invitations,
  # registrations confirmations, etc). For now you have to use a Gmail account.
  # See config/initializers/mail_conf.rb
  sendmail:
    username: "my-username@gmail.com"          # gmail username
    password: "my-password"                    # gmail password

  # Website default configuration
  # The information will be used to create the Site object, that defines your website.
  # They can be altered after the initial setup using the management area in the application.
  site:
    name: "Mconf Dev"                          # website name
    description: "Mconf Development Website"   # website description
    email: "my-email@server.com"               # website contact email
    locale: "en"                               # this will be the default locale for the application
    domain: "localhost"                        # your server address
    signature: "Mconf"                         # to sign emails

  # Default space: it will be created as a default public space, something like
  # "a space for all members of this website"
  default_space:
    name: "Mconf-Web Space"                    # space's name
    description: "Mconf-Web users space"       # space's description

  # Notifies when an exception occurs.
  # The feature is disabled by default. To enable, change the property "enable".
  # This is usually used in the PRODUCTION environment. Just copy the lines below
  # lines to the production section to enable it in that environment.
  exception_notification:
    enabled: false                                            # change to true to enable, don't use quotation marks
    prefix: "[mconf-web error] "                              # prefix added in the email subject
    recipients: "my-email@server.com my-email2@server.com"    # space-separated list of emails

# Configurations for each environment
# You can find below the sections for each environment available.
# Uncomment the lines from one of them to define specific configurations for that environment.
# You can copy any of the parameters from the default section and override them here.
# Remember to copy the entire sections: if you want to override the "email" from "site" and
# "name" from "default_space", you must do something like:
#
# development:
#   site:
#     email: "override the email"
#   default_space:
#     name: "new name"
#
# Also remember to maintain the file indented with 2 spaces. The YML file must use this
# formatting to be valid.

#  bbb_server:
#    url: 'http://dev-server/bigbluebutton/api'
#    salt: 'dev-server-salt'
